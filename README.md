# ImageDatasetAnalyzer

*ImageDatasetAnalyzer* is a Python library designed to simplify and automate the analysis of a set of images and optionally its segmentation labels. It provides several tools and methods to perform an initial analysis of the images and its labels obtaining useful information such as sizes, number of classes, total number of objects from a class per image and bounding boxes metrics. 

Aditionally, it includes a wide variety of models for image feature extraction and embedding of images from frameworks such as HuggingFace or PyTorch. These embeddings are useful for pattern recognition in images using traditional clustering algorithms like KMeans or AgglomerativeClustering. 

It can also be used to apply these clustering methods for [Active Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)) in semantic segmentation and perform a reduction of the original dataset obtaining the most representative images from each cluster. By these means, this library can be a useful tool to select which images to label for semantic segmentation (or other task that benefits from selective labeling).

## 🔧 Key features

* **Image and label dataset analysis**: Evaluate the distribution of images and labels in a dataset to understand its structure and characteristics. This analyisis can also be used ensure that everything is correct: each image has its label, sizes are accurate, the number of classes matches expectations...
* **Embedding clustering**: Group similar images using clustering techniques based on embeddings generated by pre-trained models. The library supports KMeans, AgglomerativeClustering, DBSCAN and OPTICS from skicit-learn. They also include methods to search for hyperparameter tuning using grid search.
* **Support for pre-trained models**: Compatible with embedding models from [🤗HuggingFace🤗](https://huggingface.co/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) frameworks. New frameworks can be easily added using the Embedding superclass.
* **Image dataset reduction**: Reduce the number of images in the dataset by selecting the most representative ones (those who are closest to the centroid) or the most diverse ones (those who are farthest from the centroid) from each cluster.
